**Project Mandate:** The purpose of this document is to lay out guidelines for the engineering of setting-agnostic, fictional spacecraft. The spacecraft are meant to be inter-compatible no matter what the end application is within any setting. This set of guidelines will mostly focus on engineering the volume, conceptual function, and arrangement of the elements of the spacecraft. These conceptual volumes and functions will be useful as a starting point to import spacecraft into a game that does not already include them.

**Primary Definition:** An ISS Class is a measurement of cubic volume based on the Fibonacci sequence. ISS Class 2 and higher are based on the actual volume of the ISS Class 1 specification. So the ISS Class 2 specification is 2 x 2 x 2 ISS Class 1 volume cubes of space. The actual volume of the ISS Class 1 specification is measured as 10 x 10 x 10 spaces (maximum) with a space being the size occupied by an average user (1 x 1 x 2 Tall) (So Minecraft scale).

**Tier 1:**

**Guideline 1:** If something fits within the volume of an ISS Class specification, but does not fit into the volume of the next smallest ISS Class specification, then that something belongs to the ISS Class that it fits within the volume of.

**Guideline 2:** If the smallest dimension (X, Y, Z) of something that has an ISS Class is less than half as long as the length of the ISS Class specification of that thing, then that thing gains an additional designation
