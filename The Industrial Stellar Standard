This is the main file for the Industrial Stellar Standard only.

So to explain what the Industrial Stellar Standard is supposed to be, it is supposed to be a fictional engineering standard that allows engineers to develop creations and classify them by size relative to ISS Class 1. This is mostly in the context of space-faring fictional settings. So to give an example, a spacecraft could have an ISS Class 3 Bay on it and because that Bay is ISS Class 3, it is known that the Bay can accomodate any ISS Class 3 load. This load could be another spacecraft, if the Bay were so fitted, or a load that totals to the volume of ISS Class 3. Now this measurement is relative to ISS Class 1, so the actual spaces within ISS Class 1 would have to be determined in order to determine by scale how the spaces in the higher ISS Classes are measured. If you said that ISS Class 1 was 10 x 10 x 10 meters, then drew the spacecraft according to that scale on a grid and made each grid square 1 x 1 x 1 meter, then that would set the scale going up to higher classes. In order to not make this a failure point in the standard, ISS Class 1 is described in one of the guidelines as "considered to have enough room to accommodate the minimum required systems and equipment that the Spacecraft requires, the minimum required systems and equipment that one person requires and enough space for that person to move easily, lay down and store their worn and/or carried gear.". At least that's how I'm trying to peg the base scale. So that's what I'm going off of moving forward, if the ISS Class 1 specification becomes more solid than that in the future then that will only help the project. But I'm trying to make this agnostic of any specific setting.
