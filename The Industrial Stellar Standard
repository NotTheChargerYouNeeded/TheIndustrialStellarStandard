**Project Mandate:** The purpose of this document is to lay out guidelines for the engineering of setting-agnostic, fictional spacecraft. The spacecraft are meant to be inter-compatible no matter what the end application is within any setting. This set of guidelines will mostly focus on engineering the volume, conceptual function, and arrangement of the elements of the spacecraft. These conceptual volumes and functions will be useful as a starting point to import spacecraft into a game that does not already include them.

**Primary Definition:** An ISS Class is a measurement of cubic volume based on the Fibonacci sequence. ISS Class 2 and higher are based on the actual volume of the ISS Class 1 specification. So the ISS Class 2 specification is 2 x 2 x 2 ISS Class 1 volume cubes of space. The actual volume of the ISS Class 1 specification is measured as 10 x 10 x 10 spaces (maximum) with a space being the size occupied by an average user (1 x 1 x 2 Tall) (So Minecraft scale).

**Tier 1:**

**Guideline 1:** If something fits within the volume of an ISS Class specification, but does not fit into the volume of the next smallest ISS Class specification, then that something belongs to the ISS Class that it fits within the volume of.

**Guideline 2:** If the shortest dimension (X, Y, Z) of something that has an ISS Class is less than a certain size, then that thing receives an additional designation indicating this special condition in its dimensions. The dimension classes are as follows:
```
Less than Three Quarters of one dimension of its ISS Class specification- **Harvey**
Less than Half of one dimension of its ISS Class specification- **Scene**
Less than One Quarter of one dimension of its ISS Class specification- **Primer**
```
If something that has an ISS Class qualifies for one designation but does not qualify for the next smallest designation, then that something gains the designation that it qualifies for.

**Tier 2:**

**Guideline 1:** Unless otherwise specified each area and location within a Spacecraft is accessible either directly by a walkway or by service pathways which connect to one another and that are the minimum size for an average person to squeeze into and work inside of.

**Guideline 2:** The elements responsible for the propulsion of a Spacecraft must collectively represent one quarter of the composition of the Spacecraft. If those elements of a Spacecraft collectively represent less of the Spacecraft than that, then the speed at which the Spacecraft can travel is decreased by half of its normal value. If those elements of a Spacecraft collectively represent half or more of the composition of the Spacecraft, then the speed at which that Spacecraft can travel is increased by half of its normal value.

**Guideline 3:** The elements responsible for the structure and core, integrated functions of a Spacecraft must collectively represent one quarter of the composition of the Spacecraft. If they represent less than that, then the Spacecraft is less resilient against damage. If they represent half of the composition of the Spacecraft or more, then the Spacecraft is more resilient against damage.

**Guideline 4:** If a Spacecraft has multiple distinguishable sets of elements responsible for the propulsion of the Spacecraft located on the Spacecraft in such a way as to allow that Spacecraft to maneuver and turn quicker or more easily, then that Spacecraft is capable of maneuvering and turning quicker and more easily than spacecraft of the same ISS Class that lack such a design distinction.
